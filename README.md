# Bit-Predict-Project
In this mini project, I experimented with 10 different possible models for forecasting the bitcoin prices. By far, the N-Beats model was superior in terms of the metrics. You can check out what models I used in the jupyter notebook. For the sake of training time, I only trained for a few epochs, which was only to compare the models, not to maximize the accuracy. If you want higher accuracy, I recommend you to train fore more epochs.
